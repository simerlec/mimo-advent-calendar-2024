A lady from Ancona prepared this dish in his honor and the general appreciated the dish so much that the population decided to name it for him. It is not clear, however, if the dish was invented in honor of the general or if it was a dish already known at the time that was dedicated to him. In ‚ÄúIl cuoco maceratese‚Äù (The cook from Macerata), a book of 1779, Antonio Nebbia describes the preparation of a particular lasagna called 'princisgrass' with a richer recipe. So, probably, the dish was already present in the culinary tradition of the Marche, and in particular of Macerata.",
